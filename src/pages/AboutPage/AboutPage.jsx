          RFC® — The royal representative among fitness supplements!
        </div>
        The dedicated. The hard working. At RFC, we know where our loyalty lies.
        You're not interested in average, and you certainly don't care about
        fitting in with the crowd. RFC understands, and that's why we bring you
        top-quality royal products made with the best ingredients in the world
        and manufactured in our own federally licensed facility. We make these
        formulas because we live for this! The hard and heavy lifting, the nasty
        workouts, the grind of the day to day. This lifestyle isn't for
        everyone, and that's just the way we like it!
